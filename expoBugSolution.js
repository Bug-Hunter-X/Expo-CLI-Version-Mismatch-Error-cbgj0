To resolve this, you must ensure that the globally installed Expo CLI version matches the version defined in your project's `package.json`. Here's how:

1. **Check your global Expo CLI version:**
   Open your terminal and run `expo --version`.

2. **Check your local Expo CLI version:**
   Open your project's `package.json` file. Look for the `expo` dependency and note its version.

3. **Make them match:** If the versions differ, use npm to update either your global or local version to match. For example, if your local version is 4.16.0, run:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli@4.16.0
   ```
   After updating, run `npm install` to install the correct version locally.

4. **Restart Expo:** Try restarting your development server with `expo start`.
